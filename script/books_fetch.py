fetch_books.py — Seed data acquisition for FEAT-01 (Browse Book Catalogue).

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (in plain English):
    1. Asks the Open Library website (a free online book database) for lists
       of books across 8 subjects — fiction, technology, history, business,
       self-help, science, biography, philosophy.
    2. For each book, asks Open Library separately for its description.
    3. Invents a rupee price and a stock quantity for each book — real
       book APIs never provide these because the seller sets them.
    4. Saves everything to `data/seed/books.json`, which the Spring Boot
       app will read at startup to fill its database.

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS (rather than having Spring Boot call Open Library at runtime):
    Fetching book data is a one-time job — we want a fixed catalogue, not
    one that shuffles every time the app restarts. Doing it here, offline,
    means:
      - The Spring Boot app has no runtime dependency on any external website.
      - The catalogue is stable and inspectable (just open books.json).
      - Anyone can re-run this script to refresh the catalogue.

WHY OPEN LIBRARY (not Google Books):
    We originally chose Google Books but its anonymous API rate-limits the
    first request from many IPs (HTTP 429). Open Library has no such
    anonymous quota and is equally free and open. The trade-off: Open
    Library's search results don't include descriptions, so we make a
    second small API call per book to fetch its description.

HOW TO RUN IT:
    Once:  python scripts/fetch_books.py
    Takes about a minute (mostly waiting for the ~120 network calls).

REQUIREMENTS:
    Python 3.10 or newer. No `pip install` needed — everything used here
    ships with Python out of the box.
